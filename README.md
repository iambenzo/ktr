The idea of this utility is to convert the highlights I've made in my Kindle to a format that I can use in my Zettelkasten (Obsidian).

## Goals

- [x] Read the "My Clippings.txt" file from file system
- [ ] Output to markdown using a default template
- [ ] Allow the use of a user-defined output template (a la Tera)
- [ ] Have actionable documentation
